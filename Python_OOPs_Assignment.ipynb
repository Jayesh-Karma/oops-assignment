        "# **Python OOPs Assignment**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object Oriented Programming(OOP) ?\n",
        "  - OOP is the fundamental concept in python which empower developers to build maintanable, reusable, modular and scalable application.\n",
        "  - OOP is a way to organize code by bundling data and methods that work on that data into a self contained containers called Objects, here object refers to the real world entities and there data is like information of that real world entity and there methods are same as there behaviour.\n",
        "  - In OOP we map real world entities, there data and behavior to a object in programming thats why this approach is called as Object Oriented Programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - Classes are one of the main part of OOPs, and they are work as a blueprint for defining objects. Classes work as a template for creating object.\n",
        "  - Classes contains data as attributes and  there methods (functions) together making it easier to manage and use this classes to define different objects.\n",
        "  - In Python a class is defined using \"class\" keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - Its the basic unit OOPs and represents the real world entities in programming. An Object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined its just a blueprint and no memory allocated at that time but when a object is defined using a class then the actual memory is allocated. An Object has an identity, state, and behavior. Each object contains data and methods to manipulate that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction and encapsulation both are the fundamental pillars of OOPs but they both have a very different meaning.\n",
        "  - Abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the internal implementation. For example, just like we are using laptops or systems so we know which function, key, click will what work, but we dont know how they are internally working correctly. Thats the abstractions\n",
        "  - Whereas Encapsulation means, encapsulating or wrapping up the data and the methods into a single unit tightly so that the data and the methods are hidden from the other class and can be accessed only through any member function of their class in which they are declared. The data in the class is controlled by access specifiers and hidden from other classes thats why it is also known as data hiding.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder method also known as Magic Methods are the methods which are defined by build in classes and commonly used for operator overloading.\n",
        "  - Dunder means \"D-under\" which stands for doublt-underscore.\n",
        "  - Some examples of dunder methods are: __new__, __init__, __str__ this all are dunders methods are defined by build in classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        " - In OOP, Inheritance is an important pillar. The capability of a class to derive properties and characterisitcs from another class is called Inheritance. Its just like inheriting data and there methods from a class into an another class, here from which we are inheriting is called as Parent class or base class, and the class in which we are inheriting is called as Child and derived class.\n",
        "- It improves the code reusability, maintainability and modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is Polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is one of the important pillar OOP, Polymorphism stands for, Poly means many and morphism means forms, so polymorphism means many forms.\n",
        "  - It refers to the ability of an entity or object to perform different action based on the classes.\n",
        "  - It allows same method to work differently depending upon the object it is working with.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, Encapsulation is achieved using classes, we wrap data and methods into single unit by defining classes, and control the visibility of methods and attributes using access modifiers available in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A Constructor in python is a special method which is used to intialize the initial state of an object. It is automatically called when an object is created from a class, ensuring the object starts in a valid state with its attributes assigned appropriate initial values.\n",
        "  - In python the constructor is implemented using __init__() method, its primary purpose is to define and assign values to the instance variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are claass and static method in Python?\n",
        "  - This both are build in functions in python, The classmethod is used for transforming a normal regular method into a class method. When a method is defined using using @classmethod decorator, the method is bound to the  class itself. A the result the method receives cls as its first argument instead of self, and can be directly called on the class name itself rather than the instance of a class.\n",
        "  - ```\n",
        "    class Example:\n",
        "          @classmethod\n",
        "          def class_method(cls, *args):\n",
        "                #body of a class method\n",
        "                \n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  - Where as static method does not receive any implicit first argument. It is also bound to the class not to the object of the class. This method can not access or modify the state of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method overloading is used to achieve compile time Polymorphism, but python doesn't support method overloading directly because python is dynamically typed, it checks types at runtime, not compile time. When we define multiple methods with same name, Python simple overwrites the previous definition and keeps only the last one. Altough similar behavior can be achieved using default or variable arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method overriding is used to achieve runtime polymorphism, It means the behavior or actual implementation of a method is decided at a runtime, based on the object calling it. In python this is achieved using method overriding where there is two classes, parent and child, child class is inheriting methods and attributes from the parent class, but that child class provides its own version of a method, which is already defined in the parent class. Which results when we call that method from the child class object it behaves differently whereas when we call that method from the parent class object then it behaves differently. So that behavior of a method is decided at runtime which is achieved via method overriding to implement runtime polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - The Property decorator is a decorator in python, it is a build in function that allows a method to be accessed and manipulated as a class attribute.\n",
        "  - It allows you to control how attributes are accessed and modified, hiding the internal implementation details from external code.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is Polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is one of the important pillar of OOPs concept and it is very important for developers to write more usable and scallable code, makes code more flexible & reusable as well.\n",
        "  - Polymorphism allows objects to respond differently to the same method call depending upon the object it is working with.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - Abstract class in python is a class which serves as a blueprint for other classes, defining a common interface or structure that all the derived classes must follow. It cannot be instantiated directly with objects because it contains one or more abstract methods that lack implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - There are various advantages of OOPs some of them are modularity, reusability, and maintainabilty through concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, leading to easier debugging, better organization, enhanced security and improved scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - The difference between the class variable and instance variable is, the class variable is shared across all the instances of the class, whereas object variables are unique to each individual object.\n",
        "  - Class vaiables are defined directly withint the class body, outside of any methods and the instance variables are defined inside the constructor __init__() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - It is a type of Inheritance in Python which allows a child class to inherit properties from more then one parent class. This enables the child class to combine functinalities from multiple sources.\n",
        "  - Example\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "      class Father:\n",
        "          def skill1(self):\n",
        "              print(\"Gardening and programming\")\n",
        "\n",
        "      class Mother:\n",
        "          def skill2(self):\n",
        "              print(\"Cooking\")\n",
        "\n",
        "      class Son(Father, Mother):\n",
        "          pass\n",
        "\n",
        "      son = Son()\n",
        "      son.skill1()  # Gardening and programming\n",
        "      son.skill2()  # Cooking\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ``__str__`` and ``__repr__`` methods in python?\n",
        "  - The ``__str__ and __repr__ `` both are special dunder methods are in python. This methods provide string representations of an object, but they server different purposes.\n",
        "  - ``__str__`` method is used to provide a concise, user-friendly and easy to read string that is suitable for display, logging. It is called by print(obj) when we try to print the object or str(obj)\n",
        "  - ``__repr__`` method is used to provide a clear, information representatin of the object's state, primarily for debugging, loggin, diagnotic information. Called by repr(obj) function\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in python?\n",
        "  - The super() method is a buld in function used in a subclass to access the methods and properties of its parent class.\n",
        "  - it returns a proxy object of the parent class which allows us to reuse inherited logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - `__del__` method in python is a dunder method that is called by the garbage collector just before an object is destroyed and its memory is reclaimed.\n",
        "  - It acts as destructor for a class, providing a mechanism for performing cleanup actions when an object is no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - Both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods within a class that can be called without creating an instance of the class.\n",
        "  - The fundamental difference between them is their first argument and there access capabilities.\n",
        "  - @staticmethod is a regular function that is bounded to the class itself instead of instance object, but it does not take any first argument and not able to modify or update anything in the class state or the instance state.\n",
        "  - whereas @classmethod is also a function which is bounded to the class itself instead of instance object but it takes first argument as `cls` which refers to the class object itself. And it is able to access, modify the class level data because it has a reference to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - In python, polymorphism will not work without inheritance. Polymorphism primarily works with Inheritance by method overriding, where a child class redefines a method that is already present in its parent class.\n",
        "  - This allows object of different classes that have the same parent class to respond differently to the same method call by overriding the definition defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - In OOPs, method chaining is a technique for calling multiple methods sequentially on the same object in a single, continuous line of code. This is a design pattern which makes the code more concise, readable, and avoids the need for temporary variables to store intermediate results.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "  - `__call__` method is a special dunder method that enables an instance of a clas to be used and invoked as if it were a regular function.\n",
        "  - This makes the object callable and allows for flexible, function like behaviour while maintaining object oriented capabilities and state."
